E-Commerce website struggles to provide a seamless and engaging shopping experience for its users. Customers face difficulties navigating a cluttered interface, finding products due to ineffective search and filtering options, and making informed purchase decisions because of low-quality images and insufficient product descriptions. Additionally, the lack of personalized recommendations and targeted offers results in lower engagement and missed sales opportunities. 
Concerns over payment security and limited customer service options further erode trust and satisfaction. Lastly, the non-responsive website design delivers a suboptimal experience for mobile users, significantly impacting mobile commerce potential. These issues collectively hinder customer satisfaction and business growth.
